        <h4>Form</h4>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.form.gov.sg/">Form</a>
          builder and manager used by the Singapore government and public
          healthcare institutions to securely collect data from residents and
          businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Form has been used for various data collection especially during
          COVID-19 to minimise human contact and possible transmissions.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Some of them include collecting travel and health declarations by
              visitors to the country, swab tests applications, COVID-19
              financial assistance applications and distributions, daily
              temperature declarations by citizens and mandatory primary school
              registration for 7 years old nationwide.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By using Form, it grants legitimacy to government forms collecting
          sensitive data, making it difficult for malicious actors to steal
          citizens data. It also provides rich features that especially support
          public sector needs, such as table-input fields, OTP verification
          contact details, email domain restrictions, logic to disable
          submissions and date vaildations.

              Besides that, Go is also used in training materials for Covid-19
              healthcare volunteers, press releases about COVID-19, articles and
              documents.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It saves agencies time from shortening a domain or creating a webpage
          for new content on their website and also let citizens know that they
          are assessing from a legitimate government source.
