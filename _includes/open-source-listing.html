        <h4>Form</h4>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.form.gov.sg/">Form</a>
          builder and manager used by the Singapore government and public
          healthcare institutions to securely collect data from residents and
          businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Form has been used for various data collection especially during
          COVID-19 to minimise human contact and possible transmissions. Some of
          them include:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Collecting travel and health declarations by visitors to the country.
          </li>
            <li>
              Swab tests applications.
            </li>
              <li>
                COVID-19 financial assistance applications and distributions.
              </li>
                <li>
                 Daily temperature declarations by citizens.
               </li>
                 <li>
                  Mandatory primary school registration for 7 years old nationwide.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Using Form grants legitimacy to government agencies collecting
          sensitive data, making it difficult for malicious actors to steal
          citizens' data. It also provides rich features that especially support
          public sector needs - such as table-input fields, OTP verification,
          contact details, email domain restrictions, logic to disable
          submissions and date validations.

              Besides that, Go is also used in training materials for Covid-19
              healthcare volunteers, press releases about COVID-19, articles and
              documents.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It saves agencies time from shortening a domain or creating a webpage
          for new content on their website and also lets citizens know that they
          are accessing from a legitimate government source.
