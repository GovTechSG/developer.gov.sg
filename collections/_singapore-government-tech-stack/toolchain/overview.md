### Overview

A suite of services in SGTS with security and governance guardrails developers use to plan, build, test and deploy code to production.

### What is SHIP-HATS?

**SHIP (Secure Hybrid Integration Pipeline)-HATS (Hive Agile Testing Solutions)** is the Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery 
[CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD){:target="_blank"} component within SG Tech Stack (SGTS) with security and governance guardrails that enables developers to plan, 
build, test and deploy code to production.

This is a multi-tenanted Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) hosted on Government Commercial Cloud(GCC) for all applications that is classified as restricted and below.

### What’s New? 
We heard your feedback on Annual Developer Satisfaction Survey 2021 and we are doubling down on providing solid documentation on our products. On this page, you can what 
we have recently updated and what is coming up soon! 

### Why is CI/CD important?

#### Benefits of SHIP-HATS

1. **Policy Compliance:** Standardised development tools and environment that is set up in compliance with **Application Infrastructure Architecture Standard(AIAS)** 
and **Instruction Manual 8 on Information Technology(IM8)** policies.  
2. **Better Quality:** Automated security testing detects vulnerabilities early in the development cycle helping to deliver high quality applications.
3. **Visibility & Transparency:** Agencies will always have access to source code and hence a better understanding of how the project is progressing. 
4. **Reduce Procurement:** Access to a whole suite of tools instead of sourcing individually.
5. **GovTech Managed:** The CI/CD tools are set-up, hosted, maintained and supported by GovTech letting you focus on your core application.
