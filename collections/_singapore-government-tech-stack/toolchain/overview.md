and **Instruction Manual 8 on Information Technology(IM8)** policies.  
2. **Better Quality:** Automated security testing detects vulnerabilities early in the development cycle helping to deliver high quality applications.
3. **Visibility & Transparency:** Agencies will always have access to source code and hence a better understanding of how the project is progressing. 
4. **Reduce Procurement:** Access to a whole suite of tools instead of sourcing individually.
