<h2>
  SPOT - Safe Distancing Robot
</h2>
<p>
  A four-legged robot will be helping to assist the safe distancing efforts
  at parks, gardens and nature reserves managed by NParks, including Parks
  Connectors, Pulau Ubin as well as parks managed by town councils.
</p>
<p>
  SPOT is a four-legged robot built by Boston Dynamics and the first robotic
  platform we are developing DOSS software capabilities on.
  It will help to estimate the number of visitors in the parks and will broadcast
  a recorded message reminding park visitors to observe safe distancing measures.
  This also helps to eliminate the headcount for manpower and labour needed for
  park patrols, helping to minimise physical contact among staff, safe distancing
  ambassadors and park visitors which will in turn helps to lower their risk of
  exposure to the COVID-19 virus.
