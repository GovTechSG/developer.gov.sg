<p>
  To meet the new, rapidly evolving challenges that have emerged
  as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore has leveraged
  its technological capabilities to develop a suite of
  innovative digital solutions.

<p>
  By tapping on engineering capabilities to build on its
  existing digital infrastructure, the Government Technology Agency (GovTech)
  has been able to swiftly roll out a wide variety of digital tools
  to aid and complement our nation’s strategic response to the pandemic.
  In designing these tools, developers were guided by three important underlying principles:
  <ul>
    <li>
      The technology had to be based on <b>sound public health principles</b>
      and <b>informed by the needs of health authorities</b>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Accountability</b> to the public through
      <b>transparency of data collection and usage</b> had to be ensured
      </li>
    <li>
      These solutions had to be <b>accessible even to non-digital natives</b>,
      with <b>alternatives</b> provided for the <b>digitally excluded and under-served
      segments</b> where necessary.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Timely and targeted solutions—adhering to this design philosophy—have
  been created for each unique need that has arisen due to the pandemic.
  Here are some of the tools that we have developed to meet these needs.

          The <a href="/technologies/digital-solutions-to-address-covid-19/gobusiness-covid-portal">GoBusiness COVID Portal</a>
          was jointly developed by GovTech and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) to support businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
          It allows businesses to apply for exemptions and permissions while providing them with information on the latest COVID-19 related regulations and safe management requirements for the continuation of their operations.

        <p>
          <a href="/technologies/digital-solutions-to-address-covid-19/spoton">SPOTON</a>
          is a smart thermal scanner that was created by GovTech’s
