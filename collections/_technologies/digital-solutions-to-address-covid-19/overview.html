<p>
  To meet the new, rapidly evolving challenges that have emerged as a result of
  the COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore has leveraged its technological capabilities
  to develop a suite of innovative digital solutions.

<p>
  By tapping on engineering capabilities to build on its existing digital
  infrastructure, the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) has been able to
  swiftly roll out a wide variety of digital tools to aid and complement our
  nation’s strategic response to the pandemic. In designing these tools,
  developers were guided by three important underlying principles:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The technology had to be based on <b>sound public health principles</b> and
    <b>informed by the needs of health authorities</b>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Accountability</b> to the public through
    <b>transparency of data collection and usage</b> had to be ensured
  </li>
  <li>
    These solutions had to be <b>accessible even to non-digital natives</b>,
    with <b>alternatives</b> provided for the
    <b>digitally excluded and under-served segments</b> where necessary.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Timely and targeted solutions—adhering to this design philosophy—have been
  created for each unique need that has arisen due to the pandemic. Here are
  some of the tools that we have developed to meet these needs.

            detecting and alerting operators to individuals with high
            temperatures. This minimises physical contact and time spent on
            manual temperature checks.
