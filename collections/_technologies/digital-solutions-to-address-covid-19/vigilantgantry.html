  VigilantGantry - Access Control with AI and Video Analytics
</h2>
<p>
  VigilantGantry is a fully automated, contactless gantry system for
  temperature screening developed by GovTech’s
  Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Division (DSAID).
  Driven by AI and deep learning, it augments existing thermal scanners
  to improve the rate of contactless scanning, ease bottlenecks in long queues
  outside buildings and reduce manpower required for temperature screening measures.
</p>
<p>
  As part of a nation-wide effort to prevent and contain COVID-19 transmission,
  government buildings and public venues like shopping malls and workplaces
  have implemented temperature screening and access control measures.
  With Singapore gradually opening up, commercial buildings expecting high
  human traffic are making use of thermal cameras to scan and deny entry to
  feverish visitors.
</p>
<p>
  However, to maintain a high level of vigilance, this approach comes with
  some difficulties: conventional thermal cameras cannot properly measure
  the temperatures of visitors with occluding headgear or hair fringes,
  requiring human intervention to have the obstruction removed.
  Conventional systems also require a human operator to monitor the
  output measurements, possibly for up to six hours at a time.

<h3>How does VigilantGantry work?</h3>

<p>
  <b>It is intelligent</b> - Like a smart home hub, VigilantGantry
  links the gantry unit with existing thermal camera and CCTV systems.
  Face recognition, forehead exposure and colour segmentation algorithms
  provide the intelligence required for proper screening. VigilantGantry
  highlights any high temperatures detected by the thermal camera, triggering
  a customisable alert and denying entry to the visitor, whereupon
  further checks can be performed.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    With the <b>YoloV3 person detection model</b>, face segmentation is
    only triggered when the visitor is positioned within a pre-defined
    region of interest in the CCTV optical camera. The thermal camera system
    is hence prevented from indiscriminately scanning and triggering
    false alerts from background heat signatures such as mobile phones.
  </li>
  <li>
    In <b>colour segmentation</b>, the HSV colour model picks out
    very distinct colours which correspond to high temperatures.
    Red patches in the thermal camera reading may indicate the presence of a fever.
    For greater accuracy in detecting fevers, the algorithm also takes
    the size of the red patch into account.
  </li>
  <li>
    Visitors wearing headgear will affect the accuracy of temperature screening.
    Deep learning models are used in <b>face segmentation</b> to quantify
    the amount of exposed skin on a detected face. When these cases are
    detected through the CCTV optical camera, VigilantGantry will instruct
    the gantry to deny entry and direct the visitor to take off their headgear.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <b>It is adaptable and scalable</b> - The DSAID team designed VigilantGantry
  to integrate with existing thermal scanners without the need to purchase
  new equipment. For building owners, this means lower implementation costs
  and manpower needs, adapting to their current processes and plug-and-play
  scalability according to their needs.
</p>
<p>
  <b>It can support contact tracing efforts</b> - Besides measuring
  skin temperature and performing facial indexing, VigilantGantry can also
  capture location, date and time details to aid contact tracing when required.
  It can also store health and travel declaration data obtained via questionnaires.
</p>
<p>
  <b>It is open-sourced</b> - VigilantGantry’s face segmentation algorithm
  has been published on GitHub for the private sector to scale and deploy
  to sites across Singapore. The algorithm is used to detect visitors wearing
  headgear or with long fringes which may hinder the effectiveness of
  current thermal scanners.
