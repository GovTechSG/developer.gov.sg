  HealthCerts schema was developed in collaboration with Government Technology
  Agency(GovTech) and Ministry of Health(MOH), Singapore which is a set of
  digital standards and schema for issuing COVID-19
  test results/vaccination certificates that are in line with international standards and the
  Singapore Government's requirements.

<h2>HealthCerts</h2>
<p>
  For most countries, an extensive vaccination process is underway.
There are ongoing discussions how vaccine-certificates can be part of the
effort to reopen the global economy and enable cross-border travel. There is a
need to collaborate amongst governments to support cross border prospects that
provide global solutions.
</p>
<p>
  We published <a href="https://healthcerts.gov.sg">HealthCerts</a> - a set of
  digital open standards and schema for issuing digital COVID-19 test results/
  vaccination certificates, in line with international standards and the Singapore Government's requirements.
  </p>

    <strong>HealthCerts is designed to support an open ecosystem and
      public-private partnerships. Singapore welcomes partners to further the
      work in this space, including further enhancing interoperability, privacy,
      and verifiability of digital certificates. Please contact us at info@tech.gov.sg should you have further queries. </strong>

     <h2>About HealthCerts</h2>
  <h3 id="what-is-healthcert">What is Health Certs?</h3>
      <p>
        HealthCerts is a set of digital open standards and schema for issuing
        digital COVID-19 test results/ vaccination certificates, in line with
        international standards and the Singapore Government's requirements.
        This will allow the global community to collectively improve it so that
        governments and public health authorities may adapt it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developed by the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) in collaboration
        with the Ministry of Health (MOH), the use of HealthCerts to enable an interoperable, verifiable, and tamper-proof solution which will smoothen and expedite check-in processing and customs clearance at foreign and local immigration checkpoints.
        </p>

            src="assets/img/verifying-digital-certificates.png"
            alt="Using HealthCerts,Notaise and Verify"/>
        <p>
          <strong>HealthCerts</strong> is interoperable with private sector
          solutions such as the Affinidi Unifier app. These certificates are also
          tamper-proof (data stored is immutable) and secure, protected against
          unauthorised access. The digital certificate stores identity details
          (name, national identity number, DOB etc.) and test details (type, status, date, medical institution details).
        </p>
        <p>
          For added assurance, digital certificates may be digitally notarized by
          the Government through <strong>Notarise</strong> to ease downstream verification. <strong>Verify</strong>
          provides an easy, reliable way to ensures digital certificates have not
          been tampered with and issued/ notarised by a recognised entity.
        </p>
    <h3 id="open-attestation-framework">Open Attestation Framework</h3>
        <p>
          HealthCerts is powered by <a href="https://www.openattestation.com/">OpenAttestation</a>,
          an open-source framework using blockchain to issue cryptographically trustworthy
          documents which can be verified independently without the need for proprietary
          software equipment. OpenAttestation is the base framework behind
          <strong>HealthCerts</strong>, <a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/technologies/blockchain/opencerts">OpenCerts</a>,
          and <a href="https://www.tradetrust.io/">TradeTrust</a>.

<h2>Integration and Interoperability</h2>
    <h3 id="technical-resources">Technical resources to issue, verify or store digital certificates</h3>
    <h4> Issue a Health Certificate</h4>
    <p>
       The HealthCerts schema has been published <a href="https://www.healthcerts.gov.sg/schema/">here</a>. All digital pre-departure
       test results issued in Singapore shall comprise of the data elements defined
       in the schema. During presentation, these are the minimum data types that need
       to be displayed.
    </p>
    <ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Data fields as defined in&nbsp;<a
        href="https://schemata.openattestation.com/">schema</a>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>QR code which shall contain the following components</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>A link to fetch the HealthCert</p></li>
      <li><p>Decryption key to decrypt HealthCert payload</p></li>
      <li><p>URL to perform verification of HealthCert</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Encryption shall be based performed using<a href="https://github.com/Open-Attestation/oa-encryption/blob/master/src/index.ts">oa-encrypt</a>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      QR code shall be readable by any standard QR code reader (non-proprietary
      formatting)
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  This requirement for shall apply to the various modes of certificate delivery,
  which could include sharing via
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>HealthCerts document or email which contains the memo and QR code</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Mobile application which renders the HealthCerts document as a
      decentralised document.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The purpose of the decentralised document renderer is to allow OpenAttestation
  (OA) document issuers to style their documents without code change to the different
  implementations of the document viewer. It does so by embedding the website specified
  by the document issuers as an iframe or webview (for mobile apps) and sending the content
  of the OA document into the iframe. More details can be found <a href="https://github.com/Open-Attestation/adr/blob/master/decentralised_rendering.md">here</a>.

<h4> List of HealthCerts Providers</h4>
<p>
  Providers below provide issuance service to clinics and labs such as Innovative
  Diagnostics, Gleneagles Hospital and Parkway Shenton Medical Group in Singapore
  and globally. <strong>We welcome private sector entities to sign up as partners to issue
  digital certificates compliant with the HealthCert schema by contacting us at</strong>

  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Verify provides an easy, reliable way to ensures digital certificates have
  not been tampered with and issued/ notarised by a recognised entity.
  </p>
  <p>
<h3>Global Interoperability</h3>
<p>
  To support the opening of cross-border travel, there is a need to verify
  travellers’ identity and their associated health status.
  </p>
  <p>
  We have therefore designed HealthCerts with global interoperability in mind as an open standard.
  Entities can sign up to issue digital certificates compliant with the
  HealthCerts standard. At the moment, AOKpass, Accredify. Collinson and Trybe.ID
  provide issuance service to clinics and labs such as Quest Laboratories,
  Gleneagles Hospital and Parkway Shenton Medical Group in Singapore and
  overseas countries.
</p>
<p>
  As Verify is open sourced, private companies or governments can develop their
  own versions of Verify, with their own list of recognised COVID labs or foreign
  authorities. Private sector offerings:
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Affinidi provides document verification services for attesting document
      authenticity and validation to airlines &amp; airports.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      IATA conducts verification against the rules engine of other countries to
      determine if the test certificate meets the destination country
      requirements.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Singapore welcomes working with partners to further the work in this space,
  including further enhancing interoperability, privacy, and verifiability for
  such certificates.
