<h2>TraceTogether - Community-driven Contact Tracing</h2>

<p>
  The
  <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"

  >
  mobile application is built on the
  <a href="https://bluetrace.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"

  protocol. The open source code has been published on
  <a
    href="https://github.com/OpenTrace-Community"

    >GitHub</a
  >
  to provide transparency on data usage.

  Manual contact tracing often requires infected persons to recall the places
  they have been to and the people they have been in close and extended contact
  with. A hurdle that contact tracers face in this process is the inability of
  individuals to recall these details with precision.

  to complement manual contact tracing efforts. The app uses Bluetooth
  technology to facilitate community-driven contact tracing through the
  collection and logging of encounters between users of the mobile app.

<h3>How does TraceTogether work?</h3>

<p>
  <b>It relies on Bluetooth technology </b>- The app relies on the communication
  between Bluetooth-enabled devices to arrive at estimates of the proximity and
  duration of a user’s contact with other users.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      TraceTogether approximates the distance between users by measuring the
      strength of the signals received from other Bluetooth devices (as a
      general rule, the stronger the signal received, the closer the
      transmitting device).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      It also approximates the duration of contact by interpolating successive
      communications between devices. The more often two devices communicate
      with each other, the longer they have likely been in the vicinity of each
      other.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Data is secure and private</b> - The data exchanged is anonymised,
  encrypted and stored only on users’ devices, and shared with the Ministry of
  Health if they test positive for COVID-19 . To further protect data privacy,
  locally stored information is automatically deleted after 25 days. The app
  will also cease functionality at the end of the outbreak.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Its use is voluntary for the general public</b> - The choice to download
  TraceTogether is entirely voluntary. Users can give consent through the app to
  upload the data to a secure government server.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Consent can be withdrawn at any time</b> - Users can also withdraw their
  consent to data sharing at any time. This is done by requesting for any
  identification details to be deleted from government servers, making it
  impossible for any data exchanged with other users’ phones to be linked to
  them.
</p>
<p>
  At present, TraceTogether has been downloaded over 4.2 million times by
  Singapore residents.

<h3>TraceTogether Tokens</h3>

<p>
  Not everyone has access to mobile devices. While this may only apply to a
  small percentage of the population, it is crucial that every member of the
  community can be protected against this pandemic.
</p>

</figure>

<p>
  TraceTogether Tokens are physical alternatives to the TraceTogether mobile
  app, and function in a similar manner. These tokens are being progressively
  distributed to every Singaporean, beginning with the elderly. Users have the
  option to use the token or the app interchangeably.
</p>

<h3>What’s in the token?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Bluetooth contact tracing</b> - Much like the app, TraceTogether Tokens
      send and detect Bluetooth signals in order to estimate a user’s contact
      proximity and duration with other users. Naturally, the app and tokens are
      able to communicate with each other.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Lasting battery life</b> - The battery for the TraceTogether Tokens are
      designed to run for six to nine months without needing to be charged.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>No GPS receiver or Internet connectivity </b>- As with the app, no
      location data is kept by the device in any manner. The token is also
      incapable of uploading any data automatically since it will not be able to
      access the Internet. The data will be extracted for contact tracing when a
      user is confirmed with COVID-19.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Data is encrypted</b> - Proximity logs collected by the token will be
      encrypted. Furthermore, data is only stored on the device for 25 days
      before being automatically erased.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  On 28 June 2020, the first batch of TraceTogether Tokens were distributed to
  nearly 10,000 vulnerable seniors, i.e. those who are physically frail, living
  alone or without family support. The Government will progressively distribute
  TraceTogether Tokens to the rest of the population over the coming months.
