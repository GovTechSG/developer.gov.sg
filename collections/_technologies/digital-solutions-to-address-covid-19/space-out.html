  To facilitate safe distancing, Space Out 
  was developed by the Urban Redevelopment Authority's Digital Planning
  Lab to provide the public with regular updates on crowd levels in
  malls, supermarkets, and other public facilities across Singapore.

  <h2>Space Out – Crowd Analysis for Safe Distancing</h2>
<p>
  Space Out is a map-based website that provides the public with regular updates
  on the crowd levels in malls, supermarkets, and other public facilities across
  Singapore. The
  <a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
    >Urban Redevelopment Authority</a
  >’s (URA’s) Digital Planning Lab partnered with mall operators and other
  stakeholders to create
  <a href="https://www.spaceout.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
    >Space Out</a
  >.
</p>
<h3>Why Space Out?</h3>
<p>
  Space Out seeks to provide timely information and past trends on crowd levels
  to assist people in choosing where to go for a variety of retail and
  recreation purposes, so as to promote safe distancing amidst the Covid-19
  situation. This was also to support operators in better managing the crowd
  levels at their premises, as well as facilitate more evenly-distributed crowds
  across different facilities. Space Out was launched during the early stage of
  the country’s circuit breaker in April, and we are adding more places and
  facilities to the website as Singapore gradually reopens.

<h3>What does Space Out do?</h3>
<p>
  Using an interactive map, each participating facility is represented by a
  coloured icon on Space Out, as seen in the diagram above. A search function
  has also been implemented as an alternative method for pin-pointing location
  information.
</p>
<p>
  Clicking on an icon reveals more information about crowd levels at the
  facility, including time of the last update, a recent trends chart tracking
  weekly average crowd levels and a display of nearest and less crowded
  alternative venues. With these details, users can better plan and optimise
  their trips to retail malls, supermarkets, markets, postal services, sports
  facilities and Sentosa.

<h3>How does Space Out work?</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Implementation of Space Out</strong>
<p>
  The Space Out team implemented a CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous
  deployment) pipeline to review and push code to user acceptance testing (UAT)
  and production. It functions alongside a data pipeline, which takes in data
  from various sources that will be cleaned and transformed before being
  displayed on the front-end. The data pipeline is scheduled to run on specified
  time periods for consistent data flow.
</p>
<p>Data processes in Space Out are scalable, flexible, and safe:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Commercial Cloud Infrastructure Application Services</strong> were
  used, as they can quickly scale up or down when needed.</li>
  <li><strong>By separating the web front-end from data pipelines</strong>, the team was able to
  prevent exposing endpoints of source systems.</li>
  <li><strong>Stored and fused data is collected in the database</strong> to support
  data assembly and trend analysis. Conversion is also applied to mask raw data.</li>
  <li><strong>A variety of innovative data engineering solutions</strong> were
  adopted, as the team had to adapt to the different technologies that each mall
  operator has, can put in place, or is willing to use. Application Programming
  Interfaces (APIs) provided by GovTech and other partners were also used, where
  data is then cleaned and formatted before it is piped into the database.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong
    >Data Collection and Fusion</strong
  >
<p>
  We maintain a map layer with all the facilities’ locations and names, as well
  as details such as opening hours. Data on crowd levels are provided by the
  respective malls, retail outlet operators and facility owners. The crowd data
  that originate in a variety of formats from multiple sources are channelled
  securely into our data pipeline, cleaned and fused into a single unified
  dataset, and then transformed into formats for display in the Space Out
  portal.
</p>
</li>

    >Key Design Principles of Space
    Out</strong
  >
<p>
  The Space Out team set key design principles for efficient product delivery
  and management, and to ensure that the portal is easy to use and inclusive to
  users.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <strong>Creating an easy-to-use, flexible and scalable product</strong> –
  Developers opted for a web-map application, as it could be accessed from any
  device with an internet browser, without any installation needed. The user
  interface (UI) components were designed to be modular, in order to update
  Space Out with more outlets and activity types in a seamless manner. In
  addition, the interface and information on Space Out had to be user-friendly
  and easily accessible.
</li>
<li>
  <strong>Fast and dynamic improvements </strong>– In response to post-launch
  feedback, URA’s Digital Planning Lab enhanced map symbols to be more distinct
  for users with colour vision deficiency (CVD). While the original colour
  scheme was retained, each level of crowd occupancy was now represented by a
  different icon. Multi-lingual support (English, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil) was
  implemented for greater inclusivity, and suggestions for less crowded
  alternatives were added to guide users’ decision-making.
</li>
<li>
  <strong>Designing with code for faster and smoother implementation</strong> –
  Material UI’s React components were used for faster and easier web
  development, while the Space Out prototype was designed in CodeSandbox for
  seamless collaboration between engineers and UI designers.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Challenges and Lessons Learnt</h3>
<p>
  Bringing together crowd data from multiple stakeholders meant we had to work
  with data in a variety of formats. For example, some mall operators were using
  automated people counting systems, while others were doing counts and
  tabulation manually. There were some who could provide API services, but many
  were unable to do so. Hence, we developed a range of innovative solutions that
  enabled stakeholders to provide us the information in a pragmatic, secure, and
  timely manner. One such solution included the use of custom-built telegram
  chat bots.
</p>
<p>
  We also needed to coordinate, iterate and work out cost-effective methods with
  vendors supporting respective retailers, each with varying arrangements due to
  differences in systems and contract scope. In some situations, we had to work
  with the stakeholders and their vendors to translate what they were measuring
  into a meaningful crowd level indicator.
</p>
<p>
  We worked closely with every stakeholder to understand how they monitor their
  crowd levels and manage crowd information. We also frequently touched base
  with them to address any concerns and doubts they had, and walked them through
  every step of the onboarding process. We included new information services
  that stakeholders requested, and worked with them to update the opening
  day/times at their premises as the Covid-19 situation evolved.
  Post-deployment, we continue to keep regular contact with partners to look at
  how we can make processes more efficient for both parties, and have
  collaborated with them to implement multiple improvements over time.
</p>
<p>
  Having an integrated design and development process front-and-centre enabled
  us to not only implement changes quickly without disrupting the user
  experience, but also be more responsive to the needs of our partners and
  users.
