<h3>What is SPOTON?</h3>
<p>
  SPOTON is a smart thermal scanner developed under the <a
    href="/technologies/sensor-platforms-and-internet-of-things/digital-operations-smart-services"
    rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
    >Digital Operations Smart Services (DOSS) platform</a>. SPOTON can screen up to 10 people at once, with a temperature indicator for
  each face and automated alarms and email alerts when high temperatures are
  detected.
</p>
<p>
  SPOTON enables faster crowd temperature screening by detecting and alerting
  operators to individuals with high temperatures. This minimises physical
  contact and time spent on manual temperature checks.
</p>
<p>
  As a hybrid AI solution, it combines affordable, commercial off-the-shelf
  hardware (a long-wave infrared camera and RGB-Depth camera) with advanced
  software capabilities like deep learning human face detection. This
  combination makes SPOTON significantly more affordable than most commercially
  available scanners without compromising on accuracy.
</p>
<p>
  Measuring just 90mm x 85mm x 30mm, SPOTON is a lightweight mobile device that
  can be easily deployed both indoors and outdoors with a simple calibration
  process.
</p>
<p>
  SPOTON was also featured in the OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation
  (OPSI)'s Global Trends 2020 report on Embracing Innovation in Government. Read

<h3>What are the features available?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Human face detection</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>SPOTON
      recognises only humans, not objects. It is not affected by masks, hats and
      headdresses, or by hot and cold objects (such as drinks).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Face mask detection</strong>: SPOTON detects and indicates when a
      person is not wearing a mask with an accuracy of up to 80%*
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Colour-coded temperature indicators per face:</strong> SPOTON
      displays a colour-coded bounding box surrounding each face: Green for
      temperatures under 37.5°C and red for temperatures above 37.5°C.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Detects up to 10 faces at once</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Alarm</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>email alerts</strong>: When
      SPOTON detects a temperature above 37.5°C, it triggers an alarm and email
      alert to operators. Snapshots of high temperatures detected are
      automatically saved into a local folder.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>±0.3-0.5°C accuracy</strong>&nbsp;within a <strong
        >1.5-2m range</strong
      >**
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><em>*Based on optimal lighting condition with no back lighting.</em></p>
<p>
  <em
    >**In calibration tests conducted with the National Metrology Centre (NMC),
    SPOTON demonstrated an accuracy of ±0.28°C–0.33 °C for temperature ranges of
    36°C, 37°C and 38°C, with NMC’s recommended pixel count of 10(V) by 10(H) at
    a distance of 1.65m.</em

<h3>What are some use cases of SPOTON?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong
        >SPOTON comes in handy for any environment with high footfall</strong
      >. It helps you save time and labour on temperature screening while
      keeping your operators and visitors safe.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>SPOTON has been tested and deployed in different settings</strong
      >, including office buildings, community centres, places of worship,
      retail spaces and community isolation facilities.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong
        >SPOTON can be deployed at any indoor or outdoor environment</strong
      > (away from direct sunlight and with a stable ambient temperature).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>What are some upcoming plans for SPOTON?</h3>
<p>
  GovTech is currently working on a second version of the SPOTON software that
  will include more advanced features such as pose recognition and heart rate
  and oxygen saturation measurements. This version is expected to be ready in Q1
  2021.
