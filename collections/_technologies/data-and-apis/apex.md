## Overview

APEX is a self-service API platform that acts as a centralised and secure API gateway for the Government. On APEX, users can easily publish, secure, monitor, and discover APIs.

With APEX, data collected and stored by one agency can be used by numerous other approved agencies or businesses to improve and streamline their own processes. For example, [MyInfo](https://www.developer.gov.sg/technologies/digital-identity/national-digital-identity) leverages the capabilities of APEX to enable citizens and residents to manage the use of their personal data for a myriad of online transactions, including applying for a Housing Development Board flat and opening a bank account. The MyInfo API for developers makes it possible for more applications to be integrated with MyInfo without the significant hassle or overhead costs.

APEX contains an API catalogue which provides a searchable library of APIs published by agencies. This encourages sharing, thereby reducing the creation of digital silos and duplication of efforts.

The API Catalogue hosted within the APEX Portal lists a collection of APIs published by various agencies. This allows agencies to discover, search and potentially reuse existing APIs shared by different agencies.
