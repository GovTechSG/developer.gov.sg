---

**What it is**

- A simple mass messaging system for a government officer to send messages to a large list of recipients at once. The system is given a recipient list, a template, and a channel to send it through. The system handles the rate limits, retries, and progress/failure reporting of the campaign. Supports WhatsApp today, but plan to support SMS, email and Telegram next. System is currently deployed at [go.gov.sg/whatsapp](https://go.gov.sg/whatsapp).

**Why itâ€™s useful**

- Launched on a broader scale today to fight the spread of fake news by letting the government quickly communicate directly with citizens. Plan to launch on a smaller and more specific scale to update suspected COVID-19 patients of test results, notify high risk individuals from contact tracing, and allow for easier coordination with specific communities such as residents of a neighbour, businesses, etc.

**How you can help**

- Underlying messaging infrastructure for mass messaging, dealing with rate limits, retry logic etc.

- Platform specific integrations with other channels such as Telegram, Facebook Messenger, etc.

- Frontend web development to make an interface simple enough for non-technical government officers to use.
