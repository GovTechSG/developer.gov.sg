  System for digital medical certificates to replace paper MCs.
---

**What it is**

- Digital MC system. Instead of paper, patients receive a link to an official MC hosted at mc.gov.sg.

**Why itâ€™s useful**

- Enabler for teleconsultations - clinics/hospitals are moving towards virtual consultations to reduce the need for physical visits.

- If our social distancing measures are working, then in addition to COVID cases we should be seeing a general downwards trend in normal illness spread as well. A central digital MC system provides a simple way to monitor the overall population's health. Dashboards and alerts can be set up to track flu/fever/cough/cold trends and highlight specific patterns.

**How you can help**

- AI/ML help to parse free text diagnosis field and generate useful high level classifications

- Dashboard and data visualisation development to use present the MC data (e.g. geolocation data to identify clusters)
