  Official government ID in a mobile app that lets you
  quickly check into your visited locations and verify your travel history
  & quarantine status.

**What it is**

- Official government ID in a mobile app that lets you quickly check into your visited locations and lets contact tracers verify your official travel history & quarantine status.

**Why it’s useful**

- Helps contact tracing by privately keeping a record of every place you’ve been to and, for each place, a record of every person who’s visited. This information is only kept on the local device, so it avoids the privacy concerns of a central system but allows for easy access in the event contact tracing needs to happen. Also helps deter quarantine violations by making it easy for anyone to check a person’s quarantine status, essentially acting as an internal COVID-19 “passport”.

**How you can help**

- Mobile app development to implement COVID-19 specific features.

- Web development to create admin dashboards

- Security review to help verify privacy and security guarantees
