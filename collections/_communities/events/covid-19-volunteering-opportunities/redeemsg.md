**What it is**

- Makes it easy to track the distribution of goods, vouchers and tickets. Currently being used for mask distribution and distributing Ramadan meals amongst other use cases. Prevents double redemption. No more paper tracking of redemptions.

- Mobile app that allows campaign staff and volunteers to scan NRIC/ generated QRs and update redemption status.

- Admin portal that provides government agencies and corporate/non-profit partners with statistics and operational needs.

- API that merchants can integrate with to update redemption status. Currently integrated with vending machines for upcoming mask distribution.

- Voucher/Ticket link for recipients that is sent via SMS for redemption at collection points, entry points and integrated merchants.

**Why itâ€™s useful**

- Tracking of goods, voucher and ticket redemptions was previously a tedious process. For goods distributions, this involved tracking on paper, or sending round excel sheets and collating. For paper vouchers and tickets, this involved keying in serial numbers for audit purposes.

- Double redemption could occur without such a system tracking whether people had already redeemed their quota/voucher/ticket.

- Useful for a wide range of use cases that are either live or in the works - including meal distribution, NDP ticketing, mask distribution, food vouchers, Climate Change package.

- Used by agencies and non-profits across government such as PA, Roses of Peace, MINDEF etc.

**How you can help**

- Volunteers needed to help train volunteers/staff on how to use our system.

- Volunteers needed for product support- if people have questions. If you have product support experience, we would love to hear from you.
