## SafeEntry

SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that is used to augment existing contact tracing efforts. It is also used for data collection through scanning of QR codes or scanning of NRIC at hotspots or high traffic locations to aggregate people counts at different premises. Data will be made available to the public to enable them to make informed decisions on when and where to visit for essentials to avoid crowding and queuing, thereby reducing their exposure to COVID-19.
