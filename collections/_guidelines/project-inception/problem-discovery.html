<h2>What is problem discovery? Why is it important to me?</h2>
<p>
  Before you commit to building a digital product, you need to identify and
  understand existing problems. With this new knowledge, you can build better
  products that suit the needs of your users.
</p>

<h3>How can I discover new problems to solve?</h3>
<p>We recommend that you consider these few factors:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Who are my potential users? What do they want to achieve?</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Are there any existing operations or technical constraints? (e.g. existing
      processes, systems, legacy technology)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Are there any opportunities for me to create improvements?</p></li>
  <li><p>Would my solution be helpful?</p></li>
</ul>

  <h3>How can I collect important information during my problem discovery?</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Develop a strong hypothesis</strong>
      <p>
        Coming up with a strong hypothesis and fundamental research questions help in your problem identification.
        If you notice the public and key stakeholders are interested in the answers in your research questions,
        it is a good indicator that your identified problem is urgent and relevant.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Conduct good User Research</strong>
      <p>
        Create a service that fits your userâ€™s needs with user research.
        It enables your team to understand your users better - their lifestyles, habits, experience with existing services and etc.
        A better understanding of your users helps you to make good product decisions.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
<p>
  Ultimately, information gathered during your problem discovery phase will move you forward to product conceptualisation.
</p>

<h3>How much time should I spend on my problem discovery process?</h3>
  <p>
    Although there is no set time period, teams usually spend 8 -12 weeks. Instead of setting up a fixed time frame,
    you should let the purpose and process guide you.
  </p>

<h3>How do I decide whether I should proceed to product conceptualisation after problem discovery?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Unfortunately, <strong>you should not proceed if:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>There is no compelling problem, opportunity or user need</p></li>
    <li>
      <p>
        There is no compelling argument for the Government to provide the
        digital product or service
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>User needs are already being well met by existing solutions</p></li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Tech or policy constraints mean solution cannot be delivered anytime
        soon
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Partner stakeholders are not ready for user-centred practices</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>What should I prepare for product conceptualisation?</h3>
<p>
  Congratulations to you for reaching this stage! To prepare your team for this
  stage, you must:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Familiarise yourself with other teams and organisations that are working
      to address similar and related problems
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Write a list of possible concepts to test during product
      conceptualisation. Prioritise the first idea you want to make a prototype
      out of, and provide a strong rationale.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Understand the reason for using technology as a solution. Many problems do
      not actually require technological solutions, and many technological
      solutions need support from non-technological solutions (e.g. non-optimal
      business processes). Make sure that all your stakeholders understand this.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  As your project progresses, KPIs are set and funding is invested in your
  solution. Thus, it is important that you exercise due diligence so your
  project will be worthwhile.
