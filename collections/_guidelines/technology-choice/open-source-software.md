## Where possible, we recommend that your team use Open-source software (OSS).

What are the advantages of Open-source software? OSS brings you **benefits** such as:

*   Leveraging on well-tested code and software
    
*   Potential savings in licensing and maintenance fees
    
*   Higher resource familiarity and use
    
*   Easier adoption and easier hiring
    
*   Support is easily available in online communities
    
*   Lower barriers for new innovations and the re-contribution of knowledge and resources
    

Teams should note however that there are also costs associated with the usage of OSS - primarily manpower and migration costs.
