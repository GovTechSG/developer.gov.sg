Overview
--------

The OIP by IMDA seeks to accelerate digital innovation by matching real business challenges of Problem Owners to Tech Solution providers. Innovation Calls are launched on OIP every few months. Each Innovation Call comprises a set of challenges from different Problem Owners from different sectors. Each challenge is accompanied with prize monies for wining solution that are selected based on the criteria of Problem Owners. There are three types of challenges on the OIP:

1.  Enterprise- Level: Specific to the needs of an individual organisation

2.  Sector-Wide: Championed by a Sector Lead with the aim of developing solutions to benefit entire industries

3.  National Innovation Challenge (NEW): Addresses nationwide challenges to allow Singapore to emerge stronger post-Covid.
