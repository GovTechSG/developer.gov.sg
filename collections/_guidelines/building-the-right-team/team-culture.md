## How can I create a good Team culture?

The most effective way to cultivate a specific team culture is to hire individuals that fit your company culture.

A healthy team consists of individuals who share common team values, goals and motivations, and work towards them.

### How can I create effective Teams?

Effective teams stay united and are satisfied with the impact of their work. As a result, such teams often do not need strict rules. They often take the initiative to innovate and find ways to make meaningful contributions.

[Several key factors](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/steps/introduction/) contribute to a conducive environment for effective teams.

- **Psychological safety**

  Psychological safety is a fundamental aspect of an effective team's environment. It refers to how much risk there is in saying or doing something different in a team, without repercussions.

  With a high level of psychological safety, team members readily offer each other ideas, ask questions or admit mistakes.

* **Dependability**

  Team members produce quality work and trust each other to produce quality work. Poorly implemented features and recurring bugs are examples of things that can impact dependability within a team.

- **Structure and clarity**

Team members understand the expectations of their jobs and how to achieve them. Expectations set are clear and challenging.

- **Meaning**

The process of work and its output should be meaningful for team members. This meaning can come from different places depending on the team member.

- **Impact**

The perception that a team's work is making a difference and contributing to the team's goals.
