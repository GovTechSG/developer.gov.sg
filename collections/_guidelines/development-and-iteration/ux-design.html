<h2>What is UX Design? Why is it important to me?</h2>
<p>
    User experience (UX) design is the process of creating products that are meaningful and relevant
    to your users.&nbsp; Good UX is one that meets a particular user’s needs in the specific context
    where he/she uses the product.
</p>
<p>
    This process recreates user journeys that are simpler, more human-centred and more impactful.
    Your UX design process should look like this:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Designing how people will interact with your digital product to achieve intended
            outcomes
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Structuring information so your content is easy for users to navigate</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Defining how the presentation of your product elevates the user experience, usability
            and engagement
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Running usability testing to identify friction, inform design iteration and identify
            improvements
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Testing for accessibility and addressing usability challenges</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
    UX design is about supporting the agile development of your digital product or service. We
    recommend that you continue to make improvements to your product based on user research, testing
    and product data.
</p>
<h3>What are the different UX Design Domains?</h3>
<p>
    UX designers leverage on a broad collection of design skills and experiences to develop great
    user experiences.
</p>
<p>
    In reality, no two UX designers' jobs are exactly alike - there are design-generalists who have a
    broad base of competencies; others are design-specialists with a depth of expertise in select
    competency areas. Some designers excel at craft and individual contribution, while others excel
    at leading multi-disciplinary product teams and stakeholder engagement.
</p>
<p>
    Roles also differ according to your team size. On smaller teams, 1 UX designer is enough to
    cover all bases - a design-generalist who can cater to all potential UX needs. Larger teams with
    more resources divide their design team into more specific roles (e.g. design researchers,
    interaction designers, content strategists and service designers). Bigger organisations also
    demand more leadership skills and domain expertise.
</p>
<p>
    In assembling your product team, you should spend the time to think through and articulate the
    specific design skills and deliverables required.
</p>
<p>
    You should also consider which phase of the project lifecycle your project is currently in
    (problem discovery, product conceptualisation, agile development, etc.).
</p>
<p>
    The whole team, and in particular the designers, user researchers, content designers and
    developers, must work together to design, build and iterate a product based on users’ needs.
</p>
<h3>Which UX specialists do I need on my team?</h3>
<p>

    roles and responsibilities of several specialist roles so you can find the right people for your
