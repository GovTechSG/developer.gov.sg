## Overview

The [Digital Service Standards](https://www.tech.gov.sg/digital-service-standards) (DSS) guide agencies in implementing their digital services to meet the Digital Government Blueprint (DGB) goal of delivering digital services that are easy, seamless and relevant for our citizens and businesses.

All public-facing digital services of the Government must meet the DSS. In addition, the Government conducts mystery-shopping checks based on the DSS, to ensure that our digital services are implemented consistently to meet the desired outcomes in DGB.

## Why DSS?

To help public agencies design and deliver digital services that are:

- Accessible and Inclusive - Benefit different users, including the elderly and persons with special needs

- Usable - Simple to understand and easy to use

- Relevant - Meeting the needs of users

## Design Principles

#### Intuitive Design and Usability

Digital services designed according to the DSS will help users:

- Identify, access and navigate a service easily

- Track and monitor transactions more efficiently

- Complete a transaction or interaction more effortlessly

#### Accessibility and Inclusivity

- Perceivable - Ensure contents are available in forms such as speech, large print or Braille

- Operable - Ensure functions are accessible through a keyboard, mouse or other assistive devices

- Understandable - Clear, concise content that avoids jargon

- Robust - Service can be accessed across devices

#### Relevance and Consistency

- Adopt common design elements such as a standard masthead for a consistent user experience

- Conduct regular reviews to ensure contents and services are up-to-date

- Provide clear and relevant content
