<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Have you ever wondered about who handles cybersecurity incidents in the
    Government? Look no further than the Government IT Security Incident
    Response (GITSIR) team. Established in 1997, GITSIR enables the Government
    to provide a swift response to cybersecurity incidents.</p>
<p>GITSIR proactively publishes alerts, advisories and directives on security
    vulnerabilities and threats, and highlight cybersecurity best practices to
    address the latest and upcoming cyber threats.</p>
<p>However, incidents may still occur from time to time. Agency users or IT
    teams that detect unusual activities or suspected malware must report their
    observations to GITSIR. Each Agency has appointed its own team of Security
    Incident Response Managers and Officers (SIRMs/SIROs). Together with the
    Chief Information Security Officers (CISO) and GITSIR, they work together to
    take the necessary steps when faced with possible cybersecurity threats.</p>
<p>GITSIR uses the IT Security Incident Framework process to identify the
    incidentâ€™s root cause and provide recommendations to agencies, who will then
    contain, recover and strengthen themselves against future attacks. GITSIR
    helps to triage each report to ascertain the severity of each case as well
    as coordinate with the parties involved, and advise affected agencies on
    appropriate actions. It also carries out forensic and malware analysis and
    helps the Government prevent future attacks.</p>
