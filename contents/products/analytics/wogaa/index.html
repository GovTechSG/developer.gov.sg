<h5>Preface</h5>
<p>With more people interacting with the Government through websites and mobile applications, it is important for us to
    understand how our digital services are performing and continually enhance user experience. There are many
    analytical tools in the market that can be used to track digital consumption such as tools from market leaders
    Google (Google Analytics) and Adobe (Adobe Analytics) but these tools require manpower to implement and maintain and
    may incur substantial costs.</p>
<p>Today we will be introducing WOGAA, our solution in providing digital analytics at scale for government digital
    services.</p>

<h5>Features</h5>
<p>WOGAA Dashboard</p>
<p>WOGAA promotes an open sharing platform which allow users to browse through all the different government digital
    services performances. In the following sections, we will discuss some of the features and functionality built in
    WOGAA to help you with your analysis.</p>
<p>Metrics</p>
<p>There are many types of metrics used in the digital space, each giving insights into the different aspects of your
    digital health. In WOGAA, we have identified some key metrics that are commonly used when evaluating web health.</p>
<p>Filters</p>
<p>Filters are one of the features build on WOGAA dashboard which can be used to narrow down the scope of sites included
    in your dashboard visualisation based of your analysis needs.</p>
<p>Scatter Plot Analysis</p>
<p>On the WOG view of the WOGAA dashboard, you might have noticed an additional graph - a scatter plot showing the
    distribution of sites.</p>
<p>Individual metrics can only tell a part of your website health but when used together, it is possible to obtain a
    more holistic view of your site and help answer deeper questions on your website’s performance.</p>
<p>The 2-dimension scatter plot allow you to pair commonly paired metrics that provides traffic-engagement insights to
    illustrate how your website is performing in relation to other government websites.</p>
