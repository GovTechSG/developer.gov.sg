<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Agile comes from the values and principles of the Agile Manifesto. Scrum is
    an Agile framework that provides a guide to implementing an Agile way of
    working in an organisation.</p>
<p>At GovTech, teams use Scrum to help our cross-functional teams work together
    effectively. Scrum is based on empiricism, which involves making decisions
    based on knowledge and experience. That is why our approach is iterative and
    incremental - so that we can make decisions based on results, rather than
    speculate or guess. For Scrum to work, there must be transparency,
    inspection and adaptation.</p>
<p>A scrum team consists of a product owner, a scrum master and the development
    team. The scrum team is self-organising and self-managing, which means they
    decide how best to deliver their work, rather than being directed by someone
    outside the team. They are also cross-functional – all the skills or
    competencies required to do the work are within the team.</p>

<h4>The Product Owner</h4>
<p>The product owner should be someone with vision, authority and availability.
    The product owner needs to have a vision for how the product should develop
    and the authority to make decisions. They are also responsible for
    communicating the vision and priorities of the product to the rest of the
    team.</p>
<p>The product owner ensures the team delivers maximum business value by
    prioritising and managing the product backlog.</p>
<p>The product owner is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Writing the product backlog items clearly</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Prioritising the product backlog items to achieve the most value and
            to meet the team’s goals</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Making sure the product backlog is visible, transparent, shows the
            team what to work on next and that the team understands the items
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>If the product owner is to succeed, the organisation needs to respect their
    decisions and anyone wanting to change the priority of a product backlog
    item must go through the product owner. No one else should give the
    development team a different set of requirements.</p>
<hr />
<h4>The Scrum Master</h4>
<p>The scrum master ensures that Scrum is understood and practised by the
    product owner, the development team and the organisation.</p>
<p>The scrum master does this by ensuring the scrum team follows Scrum theory,
    practices and rules, and removing any obstacles the team encounters.</p>
<p>The scrum master is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Facilitating daily scrum, sprint planning, sprint demo and
            retrospective meetings</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Needs to forecast the numbers of deliverables possible in an
            iteration, which is based on evidence and reliable source</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Needs to be an expert in estimation and planning and knows how to
            create useful, reliable and practical plans for software development
            projects</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Ability to track and remove impediments</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Acts as safeguard for his team</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>If the product owner is to succeed, the organisation needs to respect their
    decisions and anyone wanting to change the priority of a product backlog
    item must go through the product owner. No one else should give the
    development team a different set of requirements.</p>
<hr />
<h4>The Development Team</h4>
<p>The development team is responsible for building the product or service.
    Usually, there are about 7–8 people in the development team, which includes
    software engineers, quality engineers, architects, designers, business
    analysts and any other skills required to deliver the work. Ideally, the
    development team sits in the same room and are completely dedicated to the
    project.</p>
<p>While each individual team member might have an area of specialisation or
    focus, the whole team is responsible and accountable for the work done. In
    order for the development team to be accountable, the organisation needs to
    empower them to organise and manage their own work.</p>
<p>Here are some characteristics of a Development Team:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Team members share the same norm and rules</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>It is empowered and working as autonomous as it is possible</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The skills within the team are balanced</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>It is small and has no sub-teams</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>If the product owner is to succeed, the organisation needs to respect their
    decisions and anyone wanting to change the priority of a product backlog
    item must go through the product owner. No one else should give the
    development team a different set of requirements.</p>
